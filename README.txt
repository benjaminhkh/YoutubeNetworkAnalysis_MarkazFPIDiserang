Important. The files must be uploaded to a webserver (or run one locally) in order to be viewed. JavaScript security prevents running the pages locally without a webserver.

The InteractiveVis project of the Oxford Internet Institute with funding by JISC aims to allow easy creation of interactive visualisations for geospatial and network data using native web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and SVG) and allow these visualisations to be self-contained so that they may run entirely offline in ebooks and other media. The project will survey existing solutions and build the necessary components to fill in missing features and smooth over incompatibilities in between existing libraries. The project will further provide online hosted wizards to allow for the easy creation of these interactive visualizations.
